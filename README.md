# E-Commerce-Website

## Description

This project is an E-Commerce website that I independently designed and implemented, encompassing both front-end and back-end development. The front-end was developed using the React framework, while the back-end was powered by Node.js with Express.js, seamlessly connected to a MySQL database.

## Online website
- https://last-frontendfinal.onrender.com/
- Build an online website by combining Google Cloud SQL with Render
- Because Render needs to wait 45 seconds to connect to Google Cloud SQL
- Please wait patiently for the first connection.
- To test the shopping cash flow function, you can use the following account
- account:  user@example.com
- password: 123456
